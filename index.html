    <h4 align="center">Dipawali is the Indian festival of lights, usually lasting five days and celebrated during the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika (between mid-October and mid-November)<br> triumph of good over evil. The epic Ramayana tells the story of the Lord Rama who wins the<br> lovely Sita for his wife, only to have her carried off by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka.<br> Ravana plays an important role in the Ramayana. Ravana had a sister known as Shoorpanakha.<br> She fell in love with the brothers Rama and Lakshamana and wanted to marry one of them.<br> Lakshamana refused to marry her and Rama could not as he was already married to Sita.<br> Shoorpanakha threatened to kill Sita, so that she could marry Rama. This angered Lakshamana<br> who cut off Shoorpanakha's nose and ears. Ravana then kidnapped Sita to avenge his sister's<br> injuries. Rama and Lakshamana later fought a battle to rescue Sita. The monkey god Hanuman<br> and a huge army of monkeys helped them.</h4>
